# Frontend

The frontend is built using Vue.js with VueRouter and Vuex for routing and state management.

## Structure

In the `src` directory, you will find the following:

- `assets/`: Images, fonts, and other assets.
- `components/`: Custom Vue components used throughout the application.
- `views/`: The main views for the application.
- `router.js`: VueRouter configuration.
- `store.js`: Vuex store configuration.

**Note:** Right now the frontend is still in development and kind of a mess. We are working on cleaning it up and making it more modular.
